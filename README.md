# Clustering Digits using Chaincode and Centroid Feature Extraction Methods

# Centroid
 In the centroid method for feature extraction in images, the main image is divided into smaller regions or segments, and the centroid of each region is calculated. These centroids are then used as features to feed into a machine learning model for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, or texture analysis.

By splitting the image into regions and calculating the centroids of each region, you can capture important spatial information about the distribution of pixel values within the image. These centroids can serve as representative points for each region and can provide valuable information about the position, size, and shape characteristics of different parts of the image.
